# Tips for: Public Auctions

Register to Participate
:    Public auctions typically require buyer registration prior to the auction event. 

Buyer Be Aware
:     Properties are sold in “As Is” condition. Properties are typically not available for inspection or viewing. 

Perform Title Search
:    Check public records for liens and outstanding taxes.  A title company should be hired to perform a complete title search. Common liens include outstanding loan balances and contractor or mechanic liens. Do not assume the title is clear; it is important to make sure you understand the title situation. 

Read the Fine Print
:    Make sure you understand the bidder eligibility, financing, deposits, closing deadlines, closing costs, purchase agreements, disclosures and other bidding requirements. If you do not understand the language in the terms and conditions, have your real estate agent or attorney explain it to you. You will be legally bound by these contracts so make sure you understand them.

Financing
:    Payment is due immediately upon auction; make sure you have financing available before the auction sale.  Cash, Credit Card or Cashier Checks are acceptable methods of payment.  Check with Auction House for requirements.

# Tips for: Real-Estate and Private-Owner Properties

Search for Property
:    The first step is to determine what neighborhood you want to live in, your budget and price range, and what requirements you are looking for in a home (i.e. number of bedrooms and bathrooms, off-street parking, etc.) Once you find a property you are interested in conduct a general walk through to assess the overall conditions. 

Real Estate Agent
:    Hire a licensed real estate agent.  Real Estate agents are subject matter experts and can guide you through the process.  They also will represent you when speaking to the seller and seller’s agent. 

Make Offer
:    Once you find the home you like, make an offer based on the overall market and home conditions. Your licensed real estate agent can provide you with residential and neighborhood comparable prices for homes sold within the last six months and three miles of the desired property. 

Enter into Contract
:    This is where you would finalize the purchase price, mortgage or other financing and agree to terms and conditions. Your licensed real estate agent will walk you through this process. 

Inspect Property
:    Hire a licensed home inspector after making an offer. They will provide you with a written estimate of property conditions so the buyer is aware of the true condition of the home and potential improvements the buyer will need to make. The inspection report may also be used to help you negotiate the purchase price. Properties are typically sold in “As Is” condition.

Perform Title Search
:    Check public records for liens and outstanding taxes. A title company should be hired to perform a complete title search. Common liens include outstanding loan balances and contractor or mechanic liens. Do not assume the title is clear; it is important to make sure you understand the title situation. 

Be Prepared to Close
:    Final payment is due at closing via wire transfer or cashier’s check.

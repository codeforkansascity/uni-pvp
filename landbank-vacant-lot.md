# Buying from Land Bank
## VACANT LOT
**Note:** This is a third-party source and some information may have changed. Please consult Land Bank directly for the most recent information and review its policies and procedures: [: http://www.kcmolandbank.org/policies-procedures.html](http://www.kcmolandbank.org/policies-procedures.html) 

Why might my application be denied?
:   * You own property with open code violations.
    * You owe property taxes.
    * Certain criminal activities – contact Land Bank to discuss whether this might apply to you.

Search for Vacant Properties 
:   * Search the map for available properties at kcmolandbank.org “Property Search” tab
    * Drive by the property to see what it looks like in person
    * Issues to consider: zoning restrictions, special permits, impact on the community, neighborhood approval, environmental issues, floodplains
    * Consider your use and check out [UNI’s Guide to Working with Lots](http://uni-kc.org/sites/default/files/uni_vacant_to_vibrant_guide_web_8.21.17.pdf)

    If you cannot see the lot from the street, schedule a showing (otherwise skip to the next step)
    Contact Land Bank directly via telephone or in person

Put together an offer
:   * Determine the price of the property
      * Is the lot adjoining your residence? If yes, this may qualify for the $1 “side lot” program
      * Other vacant lots’ prices are determined by size. Contact Land Bank for more information.
    * Define the Scope of Repairs
      * This is your plan for the property.
      * This will become your Deed of Trust if the purchase is approved.

Apply – Make the Offer
:   Apply in person and bring the following:
    * Proof of funds – need bank statement, line of credit, or some other way of showing how you will pay for the repairs
    * Application fee - $25 plus $10 per additional applicant (money order or cashier’s check)
    * State or federal photo ID
    * Completed scope of repairs 
    * Application - the forms can be found on Land Bank’s website, but print them off and bring them with you!
      * Application for an individual or couple
      * Application for a business or nonprofit organization
        * Are you a business or nonprofit?
          * Need to have charter number

    * Background check form 

Purchase Approved? Research Title
:   * If you are approved to purchase, consider ordering a title report or consulting a title company.
    * Consider your use for the property. If it is going to be used as a side lot or garden, title issues might not matter as much, but you will want to clear all title issues if you plan on building or otherwise investing significant value into the lot.
    * All Land Bank properties go through the tax title process, which can make getting title insurance difficult.

Closing
:   * Sign real estate sale contract
    * Sign Deed of Trust (if applicable) [insert link to definition]
    * Receive Deed for property
    * You will be responsible for paying for recording fees. (Fees are determined by the number of pages of each document. See a complete breakdown here.)

Carry out scope of repairs
:   * Maintain lot and pay taxes
    * If there is a Deed of Trust on the property, it will last for three years from the date of closing.
    * If you sell the property before the expiration of the three years, the new purchaser can assume the Deed of Trust
